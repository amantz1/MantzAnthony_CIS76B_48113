		<h3>Diamonds</h3>
		<p><img src="diamonds.jpg" alt="Black topaz loose gems" width="229" height="153" class="photo" />Ahh, diamonds... nothing quite says it like a diamond.  But before you start looking for a diamond, you should learn the basics about what affects the quality and price of diamonds.  And that leads us to...</p>
		<h4> The &quot;Four C's&quot; of Diamonds: </h4>
		<ol>
		  <li>&quot;Cut&quot; (how well the diamond has been cut so as to shine brightly, </li>
		  <li>&quot;Color&quot; (how much off-color or yellow is visible, </li>
		  <li>&quot;Clarity&quot; (how many imperfections are present within the diamond itself), and </li>
		  <li>&quot;Carat&quot; (weight or &quot;size&quot; of the diamond). Each of these factors affect a diamond's value and price. </li>
	    </ol>
		<p>Each month we will feature information about one of the 4 C's. Below is a helpful guide regarding diamond color.		</p>
