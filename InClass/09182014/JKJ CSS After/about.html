		<h2>About Us</h2> 
		<p>Jean Kalen is known for a wide selection of gems including topaz, sapphire,   ruby, aquamarine, emerald, tahitian pearl, onyx, jade, and many more. Whatever   gem you're dreaming about, you'll find it here in a variety of colors, shapes,   and sizes to meet your particular taste and budget. Our stores were featured in an September 2007 article in <a href="http://www.artjewelrymag.com/ART/Default.aspx?c=bi&amp;id=33" title="Link to Art Jewelry magazine back issues" target="_blank">Art Jewelry Magazine</a> and an article in the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/" title="Link to Time Magazine article" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a> January 2006.</p>
		<p>We wholesale and retail all of our gems, so our selection is always   outstanding because we always save the best for ourselves! </p>
		<p>And at Jean Kalen's, if you're not satisfied with our selection, we aren't   either. We'll special order any one-of-a-kind item you have in mind. </p>
		<p>By the way, our staff does not make commissions on sales. Instead they are   just paid well to do their jobs well and the result is a no pressure, customer   first approach that we think you'll find unique and refreshing. Kinda like our   jewelry!</p>
		<p>Here at Jean Kalen Jewelry, it is all about the jewelry! That's why 75% of   our business is repeat business. We get that. We don't try to trick you into   buying something inferior and pretend that we're giving you a special discount.   We just give you the best jewelry we can find at the best price we can offer.   It's that simple.</p>
		<p>Jean Kalen Jewelry -- simply the best selection of fine gems at prices that   are surprisingly affordable. And our customer service is the best in the   business! </p>
